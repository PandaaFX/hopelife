if you using 'ESX.Game.GetVehicleProperties' or 'ESX.Game.SetVehicleProperties' for your vehicle properties (like a garage system)
you will need to replace only that 2 functions inside `es_extended/client/functions.lua` that is included in file `es_extended_vehicle_properties_fix.lua`

you will need to restart your server in order for the changes to apply
