Thanks for downloading the script!
For support and further updates you can join my Discord: https://discord.gg/UyAu2jABzE

Installation:
1.) Put the script in your ressources folder
2.) Set up the Config.lua
3.) Set up the language at html/js/script.js
-> To change the string, go to html/localization/locales.js
4.) Add 'start myShootingRange' to your server.cfg
5.) Be sure NativeUI is started before the script.


Important note: The server license key, your server is running on, have to be created by the same Cfx.re account, who purchased this script.
If that's not the case, you can simply use the FiveM Keymaster to transfer the script to the correct Cfx.re account.
Of course you can still modify everything you want. Only a couple of functions, which anyways shouldn't be changed at any time are encrypted. No worries!
