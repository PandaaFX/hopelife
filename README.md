# Hopelife FiveM Server (Archive)

This repository contains the resources and scripts that were used for the **Hopelife FiveM server**.  
The project was active in **2022**, when I worked on setting up and customizing the server.  

## About
- Based on the FiveM framework for GTA V roleplay servers.  
- Includes various resources such as jobs, housing, clothing, identity, and more.  
- Written mainly in **Lua** and **JavaScript**, with some additional HTML/CSS for UI elements.  

## Status
This repository is no longer maintained and is kept here for **archival purposes only**.  
It represents the state of the Hopelife server as it was during development in 2022.  

## Personal Note
This was one of my **first bigger projects** and I also used it as a **learning experience**.  
Working on Hopelife gave me the chance to understand how FiveM resources interact,  
how to structure a server, and how to adapt or create scripts for roleplay environments.  

## Notes
- Some resources were custom-made, while others were adapted from existing community scripts.  
- The server is not running anymore, and this code is not guaranteed to work with the latest FiveM updates.
